=> To test our dataset using 10-Fold Cross Validation, forecasting models, and other AI models in Python, 
   we can use libraries like:

    - scikit-learn (for general ML + cross-validation)
    - statsmodels (for classical forecasting)
    - tensorflow / keras (for deep learning)
    - xgboost, lightgbm (advanced models)
    - prophet (for time-series forecasting)
