=> Set elements are immutable but set is mutable means we can insert element in set 
but we can't change the existig valye in set. Set contains unique value


=> Operations on set:
    #1. discard() method: it only skips the value if it is not present in the set, it does not throw any error.
    #2. remove() method: it throws an error if the value is not present in the set.
    #3. pop() method:
    #4. union() method: or use operator= |
    #5. intersection() method: or use operator= &
    #6. issubset() method: check for subset

=> Dictionary: It is an unordererd clcn of items. Each item is stored in key and Value;
